Paramount bidder Byron Allen has a long history of media bids that haven't materialized,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/31/paramount-bidder-byron-allen-has-long-history-of-failed-media-bids-.html,"Byron Allen, the media mogul offering $14 billion for Paramount Global, told CNBC on Wednesday that he has the money to finance a deal, despite skepticism around his deal-making.""We have more than enough capital available to us. The real challenge is certainty of close,"" Allen said.""This deal lives or dies at the [Federal Communications Commission],"" he added.Allen, the founder and CEO of a media group that owns dozens of television networks across the U.S., offered $30 billion for all of Paramount's outstanding shares, including debt and equity.The Allen Media Group said in a statement the offer ""is the best solution for all of the Paramount Global shareholders, and the bid should be taken seriously and pursued.""Allen has a long history of making offers on major media assets. But bidding doesn't mean buying.His recent media buyout offers have failed to materialize into sales. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Allen last year offered $18.5 billion for Paramount, and was rejected.Allen told CNBC he hasn't received a response from Paramount to his most recent offer.Shari Redstone, who controls Paramount through her company National Amusements, has been open to deal-making in recent months in an effort to either merge or sell the company that's home to brands such as CBS, Showtime, Nickelodeon and its namesake movie studio.CNBC reported last week that David Ellison's Skydance Media and its backers were exploring a deal to take Paramount Pictures or the entire media company private.In December, CNBC also reported Paramount had entered preliminary talks with Warner Bros. Discovery to merge the two media giants in a deal that could have faced regulatory hurdles.Allen's bid for Paramount is the most ambitious of the deals the media mogul has tried to complete. Here are some of his recent deal attempts:Allen told CNBC via phone Wednesday that he lost out on several deals because ownership changed course on wanting to sell. He highlighted his acquisition of The Weather Channel in 2018 for a reported $300 million and broadly defended his track record, invoking baseball Hall of Famer Babe Ruth.""Let's talk about Babe Ruth. Does he go down as one of the greatest baseball players of all time? And he struck out half the time,"" Allen said. In actuality, Ruth struck out 1,300 times in 8,399 at bats — a 15% strikeout rate.Allen's bids for linear TV assets come as the media landscape shifts away from traditional TV toward streaming. Almost all the major media companies have launched services to compete with streaming giant Netflix.Paramount reported in its third-quarter earnings report that its streaming platform, Paramount+, increased its subscriber count to 63 million. However, Paramount's direct-to-consumer products have failed to turn a profit like Netflix has. The division reported adjusted losses of $238 million for the third quarter.Paramount will release its fourth-quarter earnings Feb. 28.Allen told CNBC he wants to buy Paramount for its linear networks, what he says is the most challenging part of the company.""These are still great businesses if you know how to manage them properly,"" Allen said.Shares of Paramount were up almost 7% Wednesday and have risen more than 35% in the past three months as talks of a deal have ramped up. However, the stock is more than 40% off its 52-week high of $25.93 a share reached in February 2023.— CNBC's Alex Sherman and Julia Boorstin contributed to this report.Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"
U.S. consortium to invest up to $3 billion in PGA Tour,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/31/pga-tour-secures-up-to-3-billion-us-investment-amid-liv-golf-merger.html,"A U.S. consortium has agreed to invest up to $3 billion into the PGA Tour, the professional golf organization announced Wednesday.Under the terms of the deal, the investor, Strategic Sports Group, will become a minority owner in PGA Tour Enterprises, the for-profit entity of the PGA Tour. The group will make an initial investment of $1.5 billion in the PGA Tour.The second $1.5 billion of the investment is guaranteed, according to a source familiar with the talks. The PGA Tour will get it once negotiations with the Saudi Public Investment Fund conclude. There is no deadline for those talks to end.The agreement comes as the organization tries to plot out its future in the face of competition from the upstart LIV Golf and a proposed merger with the Saudi-funded league. The tour confirmed progress on its ongoing negotiations with the PIF on a potential future investment and its discussions with the DP World Tour.""Today marks an important moment for the PGA Tour and fans of golf across the world,"" PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan said.The deal received unanimous support from the PGA Tour player directors.As part of the new agreement with Strategic Sports Group, the tour said nearly 200 players will have the opportunity to receive equity participation in the tour. These would be awarded in the form of grants, which vest over time — and would be based on their career accomplishments and future participation and services with the tour.""By making PGA Tour members owners of their league, we strengthen the collective investment of our players in the success of the PGA Tour,"" Monahan said.Strategic Sports Group is led by Fenway Sports Group's John Henry. It includes a variety of investors, private equity names and sports owners, including Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank, New York Mets owner Steve Cohen and Boston Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck.""Our enthusiasm for this new venture stems from a very deep respect for this remarkable game and a firm belief in the expansive growth potential of the PGA Tour,"" said Henry, principal owner of Fenway Sports Group and manager of the Strategic Sports Group.Monahan and Henry held a players-only call to share the news with members Wednesday morning.The investment comes at a pivotal time for professional golf. The tumultuous rivalry between the PGA Tour and Saudi PIF-backed LIV Golf has divided players, and a merger could dramatically change the sport.The PGA Tour-LIV deal was first announced in June, when Monahan and Saudi Public Investment Fund Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan announced the news on CNBC. It came as a surprise to many, as the two competing leagues were engaged in a bitter legal feud at the time.Critics claimed that the deal was a means for Saudi Arabia to gain influence in the U.S. through sports investments. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman controls the PIF.LIV Golf, launched in 2022, formed as a rival league to the tour. By offering lucrative prize money and signing bonuses, the Saudi-owned tour was able to lure away top players like Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka and Jon Rahm.The PGA Tour-LIV Golf deadline was originally set for Dec. 31. Monahan previously told players the organizations were extending the deadline based on the progress they had made to date. A formal decision on the combination is expected to take place ahead of the Masters Tournament in April.The deal is subject to Justice Department and regulatory approval.Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"
Adidas decides not to write off remaining Yeezy inventory,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/31/adidas-will-not-write-off-remaining-yeezy-inventory.html,"Adidas announced on Wednesday that it won't write off the majority of its unsold Yeezy inventory and instead plans to sell the remaining shoes ""at least"" at the cost it paid for them, as the apparel retailer looks to recoup its losses.The German sportswear giant had previously considered writing off about 300 million euros, or $325 million, in unsold Yeezy inventory after the company cut ties with rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, over a series of antisemitic remarks he made.In its announcement, Adidas said it managed to generate an operating profit of 268 million euros in 2023 after it originally forecast a loss of 100 million euros. The company attributed the profit to its ""better-than-expected operational business"" during its fourth quarter and the decision to sell the majority of the remaining Yeezy inventory.""Following the latest decision, the 2023 operating profit now only includes a low double-digit million amount of Yeezy-related inventory write-offs. Instead, the company plans to sell the remaining Yeezy product at least at cost in 2024,"" Adidas said in a news release.CEO Bjørn Gulden added: ""Our consumer, retail and trade research has shown that we can sell this remaining inventory in 2024 for at least the cost price. This is why we have only written off inventory that was either damaged or very broken in sizes.""Last year, Adidas sold about 750 million euros worth of Yeezy merchandise and donated some of the profits to groups such as the Anti-Defamation League and the Philonise & Keeta Floyd Institute for Social Change, a group run by the brother of George Floyd.It's not clear if Adidas will donate any portion of the remaining Yeezy sales. The company said it has ""no assumed profit contribution from Yeezy"" in fiscal 2024.The company declined to say whether it would donate any more of the proceeds this year.Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"
Walmart plans to add more than 150 large-format stores across the U.S.,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/31/walmart-plans-to-add-150-more-stores-across-us.html,"Walmart already has a huge U.S. footprint. But the retail giant sees room to get even bigger.The company plans to build or convert more than 150 large-format stores over the next five years, it said Wednesday. Some of the locations will be expanded from a smaller location into a Supercenter with a full range of groceries and merchandise, but the majority will be new stores, Josh Havens, a company spokesman, said.Walmart declined to say how much the new stores will cost and where they will be located. The company already has more than 4,600 stores across the country, and nearly 600 Sam's Club warehouses. Sam's Club also is in expansion mode, with plans to open more than 30 new stores in the U.S.The big-box retailer is the largest private employer in the U.S. with about 1.6 million employees. About 90% of the U.S. population already lives with 10 miles of a Walmart store. With the expansion, Walmart is signaling that it sees its brick-and-mortar locations as a key part of the future, despite heightened competition with online players like Amazon and Shein, and its own push for growth of online sales and its third-party marketplace.Walmart is also building on its relative strength compared with other retailers, which have taken a bigger hit from U.S. consumers pulling back on discretionary merchandise. As the nation's largest grocer by revenue and a well-known discounter, Walmart has better weathered inflation and even attracted more upper-income households to its stores.Its stock hit an all-time high last year, and the company on Tuesday announced a 3-for-1 stock split.In a post on the company's website Wednesday, Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner said the retailer plans to start 12 new store projects this year and will convert one of its smaller locations into a Walmart Supercenter. The move to open or expand locations is in addition to the company's plans to renovate other stores, he added.Furner said the new stores will reflect Walmart's more modern look, which it is rolling out more broadly. The ""store of the future"" design has a sleeker layout that emphasizes the retailer's fashion-forward apparel brands, adds technology like scannable QR codes and features sharper signage.New stores will also have more sustainability features, such as energy-efficient lighting, he said.Walmart's store expansion was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"
Starbucks' earnings report was weak — but Wall Street expected worse,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/31/starbucks-weak-earnings-report-wall-street-expected-worse.html,"Wall Street is shaking off Starbucks' weak quarterly report, seemingly taking executives at their word that the company's challenges are ""transitory.""The coffee giant's stock ticked higher in morning trading, hours after it reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that missed Wall Street's estimates and lowered its full-year sales outlook.Shares closed Wednesday down about 1%. Including Wednesday's move, shares have fallen about 14% over the last year, dragging the company's market cap down to roughly $105 billion.Some investors had prepared themselves for worse news on Tuesday evening. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Harbour wrote in a note to clients that the company's earnings per share and U.S. same-store sales growth was better than some had feared, ""likely supporting the stock.""Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan blamed three headwinds for the disappointing results: war in the Middle East weakening its local licensees' sales, ""misperceptions"" in the U.S. over the company's stance on the Israel-Hamas war, and a ""more cautious"" consumer in China.Executives also tried to convey that those challenges are expected to subside as fiscal 2024 progresses.Starbucks is already trying to bring back its U.S. customers through promotions and social media spending that clarifies its position on the Middle East. Executives also said the company has several new drinks on the way, which could attract the occasional customers.While Starbucks lowered its full-year outlook for revenue and same-store sales growth, it reiterated its forecast for fiscal 2024 earnings per share growth. BMO Capital Markets analyst Andrew Strelzik wrote that investors were likely expecting the company to lower its earnings outlook as well, so reaffirming that forecast could lift the stock price in the near term.Others took that as a sign of the company's overall strength.""[It illustrates] the multifaceted strength of Starbucks's business model and its ability to deliver results even in a more erratic top-line environment,"" William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia wrote in a note to clients."
"Biogen drops controversial Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm to focus on Leqembi, others",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/31/biogen-drops-alzheimers-drug-aduhelm-to-focus-on-leqembi-others.html,"Biogen on Wednesday said it will discontinue the sale and development of its older and highly controversial Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm to refocus the company's efforts to treat the memory-robbing disease.The biotech company will focus on rolling out Leqembi, a newly approved Alzheimer's drug it developed with Japanese drugmaker Eisai. It also plans to work on a slate of experimental treatments for the disease. Those drugs represent a new chapter for the company after the polarizing launch and approval of Aduhelm.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration greenlit Aduhelm in 2021 under a program that fast-tracks promising treatments. But controversy shrouded the decision as some experts had concerns about whether the benefits of the drug outweighed its risks.The federal Medicare program severely restricted access to Aduhelm, limiting its sales potential, and an 18-month congressional investigation would later allege that the FDA's approval process for the drug was ""rife with irregularities.""But Biogen noted on Wednesday that its decision to drop Aduhelm was ""not related to any safety or efficacy concerns.""The company said it will discontinue sales of the drug and has taken a one-time charge of $60 million for ending the Aduhelm program in the fourth quarter.Neurimmune, the Swiss company that invented the drug, will regain full rights to the medicine, according to Biogen.Biogen is also terminating a post-approval clinical trial on Aduhelm after failing to find a partner or external financing for the drug. That study sought to prove the treatment's benefits for patients in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.The company said it will redistribute a large portion of the resources associated with Aduhelm to the rest of its Alzheimer's drug portfolio.Among the other Alzheimer's drugs Biogen has in development is BIIB080, which targets a toxic protein called tau in the brain. That treatment has shown ""favorable trends"" across several measures of cognition and function in a small study.Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"
Studios rethink streaming strategy amid Wall Street profitability push,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/31/studios-rethink-streaming-strategy-amid-wall-street-profitability-push.html,"Paramount is making a habit of greenlighting low- to mid-budget films for its streaming service, only to about-face and send them to theaters first.As the media company and its rivals try to claw their way to higher profits, the strategy could gain traction.""Smile,"" a horror film with a $17 million budget, was supposed to go straight to Paramount+ in 2022, but strong results from test screenings brought the flick to theaters. It generated more than $200 million at the global box office. A sequel is now in the works.Then this year, ""Mean Girls,"" a musical film adaptation of the Broadway show and beloved 2004 film of the same name, arrived in theaters from Paramount, after positive responses from test audiences led the company to abandon its straight-to-streaming release. Since it came out on Jan. 12, the $36 million film has tallied $83 million globally, according to data from Comscore.Paramount's strategy is largely based on an individual film's potential performance. But box-office and Wall Street analysts expect other studios will lean into the tactic, as they struggle to profit off of films that don't get a theatrical release.In the last five years, traditional media companies have pushed low-budget genre films out of theaters and onto their fledgling streaming platforms to pad their libraries and drive subscriber growth. And for a while, Wall Street rewarded these companies for adding more users each quarter.Investor sentiment has changed. Now, as linear TV ad revenue shrinks, they want more immediate earnings growth, not the promise of profit in a few years. While Netflix is profitable and largely not involved in theatrical releases, traditional media players like Disney, Universal, Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery may need to rethink their streaming strategies.""Studios they can't just bring stuff to streaming and use those movies as loss leaders to gain subscribers because investors want to see profitability,"" said Eric Handler, managing director at Roth MKM. ""The best way to maximize the profit of a movie is to bring it to theaters first."""
"GSK posts blowout RSV vaccine sales, raises outlook",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/31/gsk-posts-blowout-rsv-vaccine-sales-raises-outlook.html,"GlaxoSmithKline on Wednesday lifted its long-term outlook following the smash-hit launch of its new RSV vaccine.The shot targeting the severe and in some cases life-threatening virus booked around £1.2 billion, or $1.5 billion, in sales after only being on the market for roughly half a year.GSK in November had forecast 2023 sales for the shot, Arexvy, between £900 million and £1 billion, following its strong launch in the U.S.The launch of the first-ever vaccines targeting respiratory syncytial virus from GSK and Pfizer last year has proved to be a boon for both companies — though Pfizer saw fewer sales from its shot than its competitor did.GSK said it now expects to generate more than £38 billion in sales by 2031, up from a previous forecast of £33 billion. In 2023, the British drugmaker raked in £30.3 billion.GSK now anticipates sales will rise by more than 7% on a compounded annual growth rate between 2021 and 2026, with adjusted operating profit rising more than 11% during that span. In 2021, it had guided for growth rates of more than 5% for revenue and more than 10% for earnings.The company's RSV shot in part drove the higher forecast. The vaccine is approved for use in adults aged 60 and older, but could eventually get a greenlight for those ages 50 to 59, Chief Executive Officer Emma Walmsley said on a media call.An expanded approval of the vaccine could address another 15 million vulnerable patients, she noted.""We are really excited about the prospects of this vaccine as part of our high-value portfolio in adult vaccination that will continue to support these upgraded outlooks for the longer term,"" Walmsley said.She added that GSK is planning for at least 12 major product launches, most of which will be in the next four years.Arexvy became the world's first RSV vaccine to win approval from a regulatory body in May following a green light from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The shot later won approvals in the U.K., Canada, Japan and several other countries.With $1.5 billion in sales last year, Arexvy is now a ""blockbuster"" vaccine, which is when a product rakes in annual sales of at least $1 billion."
Boeing holds off on 2024 guidance as CEO says 'we caused' 737 Max 9 blowout,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/31/boeing-ba-q4-2023-earnings.html,"Boeing narrowed its losses at the end of last year, but its CEO said now is ""not the time"" for financial targets as the manufacturer grapples with the fallout from a fuselage panel that blew out midflight on one of its new 737 Max 9s earlier this month.Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun, who took the helm of the aircraft giant four years ago in the wake of two deadly crashes of the Max, is again under pressure to clean up the company's reputation with airline customers, regulators and the public after the Jan. 5 accident in which a panel blew out on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 as the plane climbed out of Portland, Oregon, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane.Calhoun commended Alaska for grounding Max 9 planes after the accident. The Federal Aviation Administration later grounded the fleet.""Alaska airlines did exactly what companies like Boeing would hope that they do at moment like that and that is why the airline industry is as safe as it is,"" Calhoun said on an earnings call on Wednesday. ""We caused the problem. And we understand that.""Federal investigators are examining whether the door plug was improperly installed before the Max 9 plane was handed off to Alaska late last year. The National Transportation Safety Board is expected to release a preliminary report on the accident in the coming days.The accident Alaska 1282 was the most serious in a series of apparent production flaws, which have slowed down deliveries of new planes, and angered some of the company's biggest airline customers in the process, while main rival Airbus continues to surpass Boeing in delivering new aircraft.""While we often use this time of year to share or update our financial and operational objectives, now is not the time for that,"" Calhoun said in a message to employees Wednesday. ""We will simply focus on every next airplane while doing everything possible to support our customers, follow the lead of our regulator and ensure the highest standard of safety and quality in all that we do. Ultimately – that is what will drive our performance.""Boeing reaffirmed its 2025 and 2026 financial targets that it laid out in a 2022 investor day: reaching about $10 billion of free cash flow and $100 billion in revenue by as early as next year.""We're still confident in the goals we laid out for '25, '26 although it may take longer in that window than originally anticipate and we won't rush the system,"" Chief Financial Officer Brian West said on an earnings call on Wednesday.Boeing delivered 528 airplanes to customers last year, up from 480 in 2022. That includes the Max, 787 Dreamliners and others. Boeing in 2022 said it was targeting annual deliveries of about 800 planes next year or in 2026.The FAA last week cleared the Max 9 to fly again but said it would halt Boeing's planned ramp-up in production, which the manufacturer had aimed to get up to about 50 Max planes a month in 2025 or 2026. Boeing confirmed on Wednesday that it is building 38 Maxes a month.The Boeing 737 Max is the company's bestselling plane. A delay to production increases could hamper Boeing's financial targets and affect suppliers that have been preparing for higher output, as well as customers counting on new planes to cater to post-Covid travel demand.Calhoun has visited company and supplier production lines as well as lawmakers on Capitol Hill in the weeks since the incident, vowing transparency and to fix any shortfalls in its manufacturing. The company had the first of several production stand-downs last week to discuss with workers manufacturing problems and other potential improvements to Boeing's processes.""Our people on the factory floor know what we must do to improve better than anyone. We should all seek their feedback, understand how to help and always encourage any team member who raises issues that need to be addressed,"" Calhoun said in his note to employees on Wednesday. ""We will go slow, we will not rush the system and we will take our time to do it right.""Boeing executives are also facing questions about how the accident and added scrutiny from the FAA could affect the certification timeline for the Max 7 and Max 10, the smallest and largest models of the company's bestselling planes.On Monday, after pressure from lawmakers, Boeing said it won't seek a safety exemption for the Max 7 related to a de-icing system, but instead will work on an engineering solution.Here's how Boeing performed in the last three months of 2023 compared with what analysts polled by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv, expected:Boeing posted a net loss of $30 million, or 4 cents a share in fourth quarter, narrowing from a $663 million loss, or $1.06 a share, a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items, Boeing reported a net loss of 47 cents per share.Its free cash flow of $2.95 billion in the quarter topped analysts' expectations. Revenue grew 10% year over year to $22.02 billion.Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"

"Starbucks earnings disappoint as U.S. boycott, ‘cautious’ China weaken sales",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/30/starbucks-sbux-q1-2024-earnings.html,"Starbucks on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that missed Wall Street's expectations as both domestic and international sales fell short of estimates.CEO Laxman Narasimhan said on the company's conference call that the chain faced ""headwinds,"" including a boycott in the U.S. and increased discounting by rivals in China. The company lowered its full-year revenue outlook as a result.Shares initially fell in extended trading but recovered, rising about 3%.Here's what the company reported for its fiscal first quarter compared to what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:The coffee giant reported fiscal first-quarter net income of $1.02 billion, or 90 cents per share, up from $855.2 million, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding restructuring costs and other items, Starbucks earned 90 cents per share.Net sales rose 8% to $9.43 billion. Global same-store sales increased 5%, falling short of StreetAccount estimates of 7.2%.In North America, same-store sales also rose 5%, driven largely by customers spending more on their drinks and food.But Narasimhan said U.S. traffic lagged, starting in mid-November. He cited what he called ""misperceptions"" about the company's position on the Israel-Hamas war, and said the decline in sales largely came from customers who only visited occasionally.The controversy kicked off when Starbucks Workers United, which represents hundreds of the chain's unionized cafes, posted in support of Palestinians, leading to backlash from conservatives. Starbucks sought to distance itself from the tweet, which the union deleted, and sued Workers United for trademark infringement.Narasimhan also wrote a letter to workers in December, condemning misinformation and seeking to extricate Starbucks from the controversy.The chain's most loyal customers have stood by Starbucks, Narasimhan said. Starbucks is seeking to bring back other customers by targeting them with promotions through its loyalty program and new Valentine's Day drinks.Starbucks' fiscal first quarter also encompasses the all-important holiday season. The chain usually nets billions of dollars in gift card sales, plus higher traffic fueled by its seasonal drink offerings and thirsty shoppers. Narasimhan said consumers loaded $3.6 billion onto gift cards this quarter, breaking the chain's record.Outside of Starbucks' home market, the coffee chain reported international same-store sales growth of 7%, missing expectations of 13.2%. Narasimhan said sales at locations in the Middle East also fell due to the war.China, the company's second-largest market, reported same-store sales growth of 10%. However, the average ticket at its Chinese stores fell 9%. Chinese consumers are ""more cautious,"" according to Narasimhan.The chain has seen increased competition from lower-priced rivals such as Luckin Coffee, which have won over consumers as China's economic recovery continues to lag.Starbucks executives said the challenges it faced this quarter are ""transitory,"" but damaging enough that the company revised its full-year sales outlook. Chief Financial Officer Rachel Ruggeri also said January's sales have been softer than expected.For fiscal 2024, the company now anticipates revenue growth of 7% to 10%, down from its prior forecast of 10% to 12%. Starbucks also lowered its global same-store sales outlook to a range of 4% to 6%, from its previous range of 5% to 7%.The company reiterated its full-year forecast of earnings per share growth of 15% to 20%."

Around 80 million patients are prescribed a medicine for their moderate-to-severe acute pain every year in the U.S., Vertex said in a release.Wall Street analysts have said that the drug, which works by blocking pain signals at its origin before they reach the brain, could become a blockbuster drug if it wins approval from regulators, estimating its annual sales could exceed $1 billion.""We are very pleased with the results from the VX-548 pivotal program, which demonstrate a compelling and consistent combination of efficacy and safety across multiple acute pain conditions and settings,"" Vertex CEO Dr. Reshma Kewalramani said in a release.Shares of Vertex rose more than 2% on Tuesday following the data release.

The stock also saw a boost from U.S. approval of the first-ever gene-editing therapy for sickle cell disease from Vertex and its partner CRISPR Therapeutics.Vertex said Tuesday its painkiller was more effective in reducing the intensity of pain after 48 hours in two late-stage studies on more than 1,000 patients who had abdominoplasties, also known as ""tummy tucks,"" and roughly another thousand in people who had bunion surgery. Those two procedures are commonly used in studies of people with acute pain.The company's painkiller, however, failed to meet the secondary goal in both trials of reducing pain when compared to a combination of the opioid drug hydrocodone, which is frequently abused, and acetaminophen, the basis for popular pain medications like Tylenol.Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said the drug's failure to meet that goal is in line with expectations and that overall, the late-stage trial results released Tuesday are positive.VX-548 was also safe and well-tolerated in the two trials and an additional study examining the safety and tolerability of the drug in people experiencing pain from a variety of conditions. Common side effects included nausea and constipation."
New York sues Citibank for alleged failure to reimburse fraud victims,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/30/new-york-sues-citibank-for-alleged-failure-to-reimburse-fraud-victims.html,"New York Attorney General Letitia James on Tuesday sued Citibank for allegedly failing to protect and reimburse victims of electronic fraud.The suit claims that Citi does not have strong protections in place to prevent unauthorized account takeovers, misleads victims of fraud and illegally denies reimbursements, according to a release. The attorney general's office said the alleged failure on Citi's part has cost New York account holders millions of dollars, and in some cases, their entire life savings.""Banks are supposed to be the safest place to keep money, yet Citi's negligence has allowed scammers to steal millions of dollars from hardworking people,"" James said in a statement. ""Many New Yorkers rely on online banking to pay bills or save for big milestones, and if a bank cannot secure its customers' accounts, they are failing in their most basic duty.""Citigroup, the parent company of Citibank, has struggled with risk management and controls in the past. Former executives have said the bank — the product of decades of mergers that created a patchwork of technology systems — underinvested in its infrastructure. That was evident when Citigroup accidentally sent almost $900 million to Revlon's lenders in 2020.Later that year, banking regulators fined Citigroup $400 million and ordered the firm to improve its risk management systems. Since taking over in 2021, CEO Jane Fraser has pushed to improve the bank's technology and appease regulators.The New York lawsuit includes specific people who had thousands of dollars stolen from their accounts and said the bank did not reimburse them.In a statement, Citi said the bank ""works extremely hard"" to prevent threats and assist customers who become victims of fraud.""Banks are not required to make customers whole when those customers follow criminals' instructions and banks can see no indication the customers are being deceived. However, given the industry-wide surge in wire fraud during the last several years, we've taken proactive steps to safeguard our clients' accounts with leading security protocols, intuitive fraud prevention tools, clear insights about the latest scams, and driving client awareness and education,"" the company said in a statement. ""Our actions have reduced client wire fraud losses significantly, and we remain committed to investing in fraud prevention measures to help our clients secure their accounts against emerging threats.""James alleged in the lawsuit that Citi must reimburse victims of fraud under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act.Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"
Carnival reroutes cruises as Red Sea tensions rise,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/30/carnival-reroutes-cruises-as-tensions-rise-in-the-middle-east-.html,"Carnival announced on Tuesday that it would reroute cruise itineraries for a dozen ships scheduled to transit the Red Sea as tensions rise in the Middle East.""Given recent developments and in close consultation with global security experts and government authorities, the company has made the decision to reroute itineraries for 12 ships across seven brands, which were scheduled to transit the Red Sea through May 2024,"" the cruise line said in a press release.Repeated attacks on vessels by Iranian-backed Houthi Rebels have forced major shipping and oil companies to divert their routes, adding days to shipping times and driving up costs.The U.S. has responded by striking the Houthis in Yemen, but U.S. President Joe Biden admitted earlier this month the retaliation was not stopping the group. A weekend attack by Iranian-backed militants killed three U.S. service members in Jordan and also heightened tensions in the region.Carnival expects the rerouting to affect its adjusted earnings per share by 7 cents to 8 cents in 2024. The company forecast adjusted full-year earnings per share of 93 cents, according to its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings released last month. The cruise liner is expected to release its fiscal 2024 first-quarter earnings in March.Carnival is the latest company to announce disruptions due to the conflicts in the Red Sea. Earlier this month, Royal Caribbean and Swiss-Italian operator MSC Cruises said they would cancel trips in the region.A spokesperson for Carnival told CNBC the cruise line or a travel advisor would directly contact customers affected by the changes.Shares of Carnival traded flat Tuesday. The stock is up more than 50% in the past year. While bookings have rebounded from the Covid-19 pandemic, the stock is almost 70% off its pre-pandemic high.Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"
"Healthy Returns: J&J, Merck and Bristol Myers Squibb are in the hot seat",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/30/healthy-returns-jj-merck-and-bristol-myers-squibb-in-the-hot-seat.html,"Think a friend or colleague should be getting this newsletter? Share this link with them to sign up.Good afternoon! This is Annika Kim Constantino, and I cover the biotech and pharmaceutical industry for CNBC.com.Three names in the industry – Johnson & Johnson, Merck and Bristol Myers Squibb – face a pivotal few weeks ahead.CEOs from those companies are slated to testify at a Senate hearing on high prescription drug prices in the U.S. on Feb. 8 at 10 a.m. ET, Sen. Bernie Sanders announced Friday.It took subpoena threats from the senator, but J&J CEO Joaquin Duato and Merck CEO Robert Davis have agreed to testify after both executives declined earlier requests to appear at the Senate HELP committee's hearing. They join Bristol Myers Squibb CEO Chris Boerner, who agreed to the panel's initial invitation to appear.Sanders hopes the hearing could bear some fruit for Americans, especially after Eli Lilly's CEO promised not to raise the prices of the company's insulin products during a similar grilling the panel held in May.But why is the committee targeting Merck, J&J and Bristol Myers Squibb in the first place? Sanders noted that all three companies manufacture some of the most expensive drugs sold in the U.S.: Merck's diabetes drug Januvia, Bristol Myers Squibb's blood thinner Eliquis and J&J's immunosuppressive medication Stelara.He's not wrong:Those prices don't reflect the exact cost people with insurance pay out of pocket.Still, data from the Biden administration suggests that some older adults with Medicare Part D coverage still pay hundreds of dollars for those medications. On average, Medicare enrollees paid $2,058 for Stelara, $441 for Eliquis and $270 for Januvia out of pocket in 2022, a fact sheet from the administration said.That's why the three drugs will be subject to the first round of Medicare drug price negotiations, a key policy under the Inflation Reduction Act that aims to make costly medications more affordable for seniors. J&J, Merck and Bristol Myers Squib are all suing to halt the talks, which will establish new prices that will go into effect in 2026.Those discussions are going to heat up on Thursday, when Medicare will make initial price offers for each of the 10 drugs selected for negotiations.Merck, J&J and Bristol Myers Squibb are also facing pressure for another reason: billions of revenue will be at risk after some of their blockbuster drugs tumble off a ""patent cliff"" over the next few years.That refers to when a company's patents for one or more leading branded products expire, which allows for competitors to sell copycats of those drugs, often at a lower price. That usually causes revenue to fall for drugmakers and costs to drop for patients, who can access similar but more affordable drug options.I did a deep dive on patent cliffs this weekend and zeroed in on some of the biggest medicines with key upcoming patent expirations:""When you step back from it all, lowering drug costs for patients and opening it up to a broader set of people is a great thing,"" Mike Perrone, Baird's biotech specialist, told CNBC. ""So, while it's a problem for these pharma companies, it's a help to the system and that's why it's created."""

Tomé said the international softness was ""heavily weighted"" in Europe, coupled with freight complications in the Red Sea region, as well as the Panama and Suez canals.Though the earnings report did not directly mention any financial impacts from negotiations with the Teamsters in August over labor contracts, Tomé cited the talks and the macroeconomic environment more broadly as contributing to the ""disappointing"" year.The company also said it's considering selling its Coyote truck brokerage business, which Tomé called a ""highly cyclical"" business with ""considerable earnings volatility."" The CEO also added that the company is planning to ask workers to return to the office five days a week in 2024.UPS' 2024 outlook expects revenue to range from $92 billion to $94.5 billion, with an adjusted operating margin of about 10% to 10.6%.Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"

Most of GM's main competitors offer traditional hybrids as well as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.""Let me be clear, GM remains committed to eliminating tailpipe emissions from our light-duty vehicles by 2035, but, in the interim, deploying plug-in technology in strategic segments will deliver some of the environment or environmental benefits of EVs as the nation continues to build this charging infrastructure,"" Barra said during the automaker's quarterly and 2023 earnings call.Barra alluded to the automaker using plug-in hybrid technology that the company has already adopted overseas in countries such as China. The only hybrid GM currently offers in the U.S. is a traditional hybrid version of the Chevrolet Corvette.GM led the way for plug-in electric vehicles with the Chevrolet Volt during the 2010s. The company discontinued the vehicle in early 2019, citing demand and cost concerns.The Detroit automaker previously planned to forgo plug-in hybrid vehicles and move all of its traditional cars and trucks with internal combustion engines to all-electric models for consumers.The shifting strategies are counterintuitive to the industry's recent messaging on EVs. Many auto companies have begun to invest billions of dollars in all-electric vehicles, and the Biden administration has made a push to get more EVs on U.S. roadways as quickly as possible.Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"

Pfizer beats on earnings as Covid business loses less revenue than expected,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/30/pfizer-pfe-q4-earnings-report-2023.html,"Pfizer on Tuesday posted a surprise adjusted fourth-quarter profit, as the company's declining Covid business loss less revenue than expected.The company reversed roughly $3.5 billion in revenue related to the expected return of 6.5 million doses of its Covid drug, Paxlovid, from the U.S. government. That hit is less than the $4.2 billion Pfizer initially expected for the return of nearly eight million doses of Paxlovid.The company sees the fewer-than-expected returned Paxlovid doses as an ""encouraging sign"" because it indicates that use of the drug increased in the fourth quarter, Pfizer Chief Financial Officer Dave Denton told CNBC in an interview.Pfizer's Covid vaccine raked in $5.36 billion in revenue for the quarter, down 53% from the same period last year. Analysts had expected the shot to bring in $4.99 billion in sales, according to FactSet estimates.Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told CNBC around 15% of the U.S. population received an updated Covid vaccine this fall and winter. That's slightly lower than the 17% Pfizer forecast in October, a month after the company's new shot rolled out.The results come as Pfizer tries to blunt the rapid decline of its Covid business, which saw demand plummet to new lows and transitioned to the commercial market in the U.S. last year. As revenue suffers, the company is trying to improve its bottom line and boost investor confidence through a broad $4 billion cost-cutting plan.Here's what Pfizer reported for the fourth quarter compared to what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:The pharmaceutical giant also reiterated its full-year 2024 guidance, which it first outlined in mid-December.Pfizer expects revenue to come in between $58.5 billion and $61.5 billion this year, which includes roughly $8 billion in revenue from its Covid products and contributions from its recently closed acquisition of cancer drug developer Seagen.The company expects to book adjusted earnings of $2.05 to $2.25 per share.Pfizer recorded fourth-quarter revenue of $14.25 billion, down 41% from the same period a year ago, due to the plunge in sales of its Covid products.For the fourth quarter, Pfizer booked a net loss of $3.37 billion, or 60 cents per share. That compares to a net income of $4.99 billion, or 87 cents per share, during the same period a year ago.Excluding certain items, the company posted earnings per share of 10 cents for the quarter. Still, Pfizer's Covid business had a dismal 2023.Revenue from its Covid vaccine and Paxlovid came in at $12.5 billion in 2023. That's down 78% from their $57 billion peak in 2022."

Big pharma is preparing to lose revenue from blockbuster drugs,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/28/big-pharma-merck-bristol-myers-jj-prepare-to-lose-revenue.html,"Big pharmaceutical companies such as Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck and Johnson & Johnson face a looming threat that will put tens of billions of dollars in sales at risk between now and 2030, as blockbuster drugs will tumble off a so-called patent cliff.That refers to when a company's patents for one or more leading branded products expire, which opens the door for competitors to sell copycats of those drugs, often at a lower price. That typically causes revenue to fall for drugmakers and costs to drop for patients, who can access more affordable options.Certain drugmakers appear well prepared to offset some losses from upcoming patent cliffs, as they build their drug pipelines and ink acquisitions or partnerships with other companies, some Wall Street analysts said.Patent cliffs are an unavoidable issue for pharmaceutical companies. They must replenish older top-selling drugs with new ones that they hope will not just sustain their sales, but also grow them.The loss of exclusive rights on a drug can affect companies differently, depending on how much of their sales they get from the product or what type of treatment it is. Some drugs facing patent expirations will also be subject to the Biden administration's Medicare drug price negotiations, a policy that may further threaten the companies' revenues.The top 20 biopharma companies have $180 billion in sales at risk from patent expirations between now and 2028, according to estimates from EY.""It does differ by company at this stage, and I think there are a number of products in the '25, '30 timeframe that will be major growth drivers for large biopharma companies … but all in all, there are plenty of companies that have revenue holes to plug,"" William Blair & Company analyst Matt Phipps told CNBC."

Po!""Those four names, the iconic sing-song intro to the ""The Teletubbies,"" have graced household TVs for nearly 30 years. While the library of episodes hasn't changed in decades, their role in American media has taken on new meaning in the age of streaming.""Back in the day TV was a little simpler,"" said Dean Koocher a television expert, who spent years bringing international kids shows, including ""Teletubbies"" and ""The Wiggles,"" to the Americas.""Back then there were less gatekeepers, you know, there was PBS, Disney and Nickelodeon was kind of an upstart coming up,"" Koocher told CNBC. ""The good thing was, if you ever could get their eyeballs, you had a much bigger piece of the market, because there weren't that many choices for kids.""Now, shows aren't just on traditional TV and there are far more places for parents and kids to find content. From YouTube and TikTok to dozens of streaming options, audiences don't need to wait to watch their favorite shows. Saturday morning cartoons are now everyday-anytime cartoons.And that's good for streamers, too, especially as Wall Street profitability pressures mount.Kids represent a unique demographic for the entertainment industry. Age-specific advertising laws mean companies can't market directly to them in many cases, but their viewing habits — often favoring repetition of content — makes them exceptionally loyal consumers.At a time when streaming services are eager to lure in new subscribers and decrease churn, having a hub for family-friendly content is one way to ensure paying members (i.e. parents) stick around.""Kids and family-friendly content is critically important to both streaming acquisition and retention,"" said Peter Csathy, founder and chair of advisory firm Creative Media. ""Franchise family-friendly brands are welcomed by exhausted parents looking for some down time as their kids get their screen time.""Once those kids are hooked on a show, they never leave and will not let their parents even think of leaving,"" he added.That's vitally important for streaming services, especially as consumers grow more cost-conscious and weigh which services to keep month after month and which services to ditch before the next billing cycle.In recent years, legacy media companies — like Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, Universal and Paramount — have scrambled to compete with Netflix in the streaming realm. For a while, Wall Street was satisfied with high subscriber growth and the promise of profitability in the future. However, as ad revenue from linear TV continued to decline significantly, investors quickly reversed course, demanding more immediate earnings growth."

But he said in a statement late Friday that, ""out of respect for the WWE Universe, the extraordinary TKO business and its board members and shareholders, partners and constituents, and all of the employees and Superstars who helped make WWE into the global leader it is today, I have decided to resign from my executive chairmanship and the TKO board of directors, effective immediately.""The latest allegations against McMahon were in a lawsuit filed by Janel Grant — who alleges McMahon directed her to have sex with a WWE ""superstar"" and other men. Grant's suit seeks to void a nondisclosure agreement Grant said she reached with McMahon in early 2022.Grant's suit in U.S. District Court in Connecticut says the billionaire McMahon agreed to pay her $3 million as part of that deal, but ended up only paying her $1 million in exchange for her silence about his conduct.In addition to McMahon, 78, the complaint names as defendants WWE and John Laurinaitis, the company's former head of talent relations and general manager.The complaint comes six months after federal law enforcement agents executed a search warrant on McMahon and served him with a grand jury subpoena as part of an investigation into McMahon's payment of millions of dollars to multiple women, among them Grant, after allegations of sexual misconduct.McMahon, who resigned from WWE leadership posts in mid-2022 amid an internal company investigation, only to return as its leader in early 2023, last March paid WWE $17.4 million to cover costs of a probe of those payouts by a law firm retained by the company."

"Merck, J&J CEOs agree to testify in Senate hearing on high drug prices ",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/26/merck-jj-ceos-agree-to-testify-in-senate-hearing-on-drug-prices-.html,"The CEOs of Merck and Johnson & Johnson have voluntarily agreed to testify at an upcoming Senate hearing on high drug prices in the U.S., Sen. Bernie Sanders announced Friday, as lawmakers ramp up efforts to rein in health-care costs for Americans.The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee's hearing is scheduled for Feb. 8 at 10 a.m. ET.The panel had planned to vote to subpoena J&J CEO Joaquin Duato and Merck CEO Robert Davis to testify after both executives declined earlier requests to appear at the hearing. Those subpoenas would have been the first issued by the committee since 1981.Meanwhile, Bristol Myers Squibb CEO Chris Boerner agreed to an initial invitation to testify.The panel will ask each executive to provide testimony about why their companies charge substantially higher prices for medicine in the U.S. than in other countries. The push to cut drug prices is one of the rare issues that has united both major political parties in recent years — though they have often backed different approaches to doing so.Sanders, who chairs the Senate Health panel, noted that all three companies manufacture some of the most expensive drugs sold in the U.S., including Merck's diabetes drug Januvia, J&J's blood cancer treatment Imbruvica and Bristol Myers Squibb's blood thinner Eliquis.All three of those treatments will be subject to the first round of Medicare drug price negotiations, a key policy under President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act that aims to make costly medications more affordable for seniors. J&J, Merck and Bristol Myers Squib are all suing to halt the talks, which will establish new prices that will go into effect in 2026.""I hope very much that the CEOs of these major pharmaceutical companies will take a serious look at these incredible price discrepancies and work with us to substantially reduce the prices they charge the American people for these and other prescription drugs,"" Sanders said in a statement Friday."
Probe into GM's Cruise finds poor leadership at center of accident response,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/gm-cruise-probe-finds-poor-leadership-at-center-of-incident-response.html,"Culture issues, ineptitude and poor leadership at General Motors' Cruise autonomous vehicle unit were at the center of regulatory oversights and coverup concerns that have plagued the company since October, according to the findings of a third-party probe.The report addresses, in part, controversy that has swirled around Cruise since an Oct. 2 accident in which a pedestrian in San Francisco was dragged 20 feet by a Cruise robotaxi after being struck by a separate vehicle. Results of the investigation, which reviewed whether Cruise representatives misled investigators or members of the media in discussing the incident, were published Thursday in a 105-page report.Despite the findings, which pointed to widespread issues with company culture, the third-party probe found that the evidence to date ""does not establish that Cruise leadership or personnel intended to deceive or mislead regulators"" during briefings a day after the accident, according to a summary of the report released by Cruise.Cruise remains under investigation by several entities, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Several Cruise leaders and employees — most of whom are no longer employed by the company — attempted to show regulators a video of the incident, according to the findings, but were only able to do so in one of several initial meetings due to connection or ""video transmission issues."" Although the intent to share the information had been there, the report found, the Cruise representatives subsequently failed to properly inform some regulators or officials of everything that occurred.""The problem is that when the video froze, literally and figuratively, the Cruise employees froze in the moment, and nobody thought to speak up and fill in the detail,"" a person close to the investigation told CNBC.Some employees also failed to update or correct company statements that omitted such information and attempted to deflect blame on the human hit-and-run driver who initially struck the pedestrian.The report outlines multiple instances in which then-CEO and co-founder Kyle Vogt, who resigned in late November, made the final calls to withhold information, specifically regarding media."
JPMorgan Chase shuffles top leaders as race to succeed Jamie Dimon drags on,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/jpmorgan-chase-shuffles-top-leaders-under-jamie-dimon.html,"JPMorgan Chase on Thursday said several executives considered front-runners to one day take over for CEO Jamie Dimon had new or expanded roles.Jennifer Piepszak, co-head of JPMorgan's giant consumer bank, will now became co-head of the firm's commercial and investment bank along with Troy Rohrbaugh, a veteran leader of the bank's trading operations.Piepszak's former partner, Marianne Lake, will transition from consumer banking co-head to being its sole CEO, JPMorgan said. The business includes some of the country's largest operations in retail banking, credit cards and small business lending.The moves should give Piepszak and Lake more experience as the long-running succession race atop the nation's largest bank drags on. When they were made co-heads of consumer banking in 2021, Piepszak and Lake were considered favorites to eventually succeed Dimon, who is now 67 years old. That year, the bank's board gave Dimon a special bonus to retain his services for a ""significant number of years.""It wasn't clear if there is a front-runner for the job after the latest set of changes, or if Dimon intends to leave anytime soon.The running joke within JPMorgan is that for Dimon, considered the top banker of his generation, retirement is always five years away. Over the years, several of his deputies have moved on to lead other organizations after losing patience that the top job would ever become available.Rohrbaugh and global payments chief Takis Georgakopoulos round out the short list of potential successors along with Lake and Piepszak, who have both served as CFO before their current assignments, said a person with knowledge of the bank's planning.As part of the changes, the bank's new commercial and investment bank run by Piepszak and Rohrbaugh now includes operations that had been a separate division run by Doug Petno. And Daniel Pinto, who had been CEO of the corporate and investment bank for a decade, relinquishes that title while remaining the bank's president and chief operating officer.Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"
